Final Project Proposal

Hello, I'm Ethan and I'm majoring in Computer Science, but I'm not exactly sure
what kind of programming I want to be doing in my future. Right now I am mostly
interested in machine learning or AI kind of stuff, but I also like gaming technology.

For my final project, I think I want to build an application to manage finances, but one
that focuses on monthly recurring fees and budgeting. MY three entities will be Users, Accounts/Fees, and Budgets.
